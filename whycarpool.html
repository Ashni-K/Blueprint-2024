      <p>Do you have a work meeting in the morning and can't get your kids to school? Do you want to save time and join a
        carpooling group for your kid's soccer games? Do you need to get to an event, but someone else is using the car? 
        Whatever the conflict may be, carpooling provides a solution. You can join a carpool on the day of or schedule a 
        weekly carpooling group with others going to the same activity. Either way, it's an easy way to get to your destination. </p>

      <h3>Have a positive impact on the environment</h3>
      <p>By carpooling, you can reduce the number of cars on the road and your carbon emissions. You can make an impact on traffic 
        congestion in your neighborhood, helping everyone save time all while having a positive impact on the environment. In fact, 
        carpooling can reduce the carbon footprint of an average household by up to 2,000 pounds (1 ton) of carbon dioxide emissions annually.</p>

      <h3>Engage with your community</h3>
      <p>Our carpooling service provides a unique opportunity to get involved in your community. You can join carpooling groups so that you and 
        your neighbors can switch off who takes your kids to school each day, pick your neighbor up on your way to a function, or get to know a 
        new neighbor on your way to work. However you use it, it's a great way to connect with your community.</p>
